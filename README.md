# Deadlock Laning Preference Reminder
This tool will run in the background and pop up a reminder whenever you start Deadlock to update your laning preferences. Check the releases page for the installer, which will automatically insert this into your startup applications so it will auto run. Ideally this tool will not be needed in the future :)
